#This module uses vcftools to calculate Fst from a .vcf file
for each gene provided by a biomart file

# Inputs
This module takes a file with .vcf extension with the coordinates of the genes
provided by mart_export.txt ,a biomart file with gene coordinates and
two files with IDs for specific populations (the ones the user want to use
for Fst calculation)

#Example:

out.recode.vcf
mart_export.txt
pop.chb
pop.pel

# Output
A .log and .log.weir.fst files for each gene

# Dependencies

 vcftools:
 Version 0.1.15 (or more actualizated versions)
